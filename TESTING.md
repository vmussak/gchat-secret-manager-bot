# Testing Guide

This guide helps you test the Google Chat Secret Manager Bot functionality.

## Prerequisites

- Bot is running (locally or deployed)
- Service account has proper permissions
- Google Chat app is configured
- At least one test secret exists

## Create Test Secrets

### Using gcloud CLI

```bash
# Set your project
export PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"

# Create a test secret
echo -n "TestSecretValue123" | gcloud secrets create test-api-key \
  --project=$PROJECT_ID \
  --replication-policy="automatic" \
  --data-file=-

# Grant access to service account
gcloud secrets add-iam-policy-binding test-api-key \
  --project=$PROJECT_ID \
  --member="serviceAccount:gchat-secret-bot@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor"
```

### Using the helper script

```bash
cd examples
chmod +x create-test-secret.sh
./create-test-secret.sh your-project-id test-api-key "MySecretValue"
```

curl https://your-bot-url/health
```

**Expected:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "pendingRequests": 0
}
```

---

## Automated Testing Script

Create a test script to verify basic functionality:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

BOT_URL="https://your-bot-url"

# Test health endpoint
echo "Testing health endpoint..."
curl -s $BOT_URL/health | jq .

# Test webhook endpoint (should return 200)
echo "Testing webhook endpoint..."
curl -X POST $BOT_URL/webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "MESSAGE",
    "message": {
      "text": "help"
    },
    "user": {
      "name": "users/test",
      "displayName": "Test User",
      "email": "test@example.com"
    },
    "space": {
      "name": "spaces/test"
    }
  }'
```

## Troubleshooting Tests

### Test Fails: Bot Doesn't Respond

**Check:**
- [ ] Bot is running: `curl https://your-bot-url/health`
- [ ] Webhook URL is correct in Google Chat config
- [ ] Check bot logs for errors

### Test Fails: "Error fetching secret"

**Check:**
- [ ] Project ID is correct
- [ ] Secret exists: `gcloud secrets describe SECRET_NAME --project=PROJECT_ID`
- [ ] Service account has access:
```bash
gcloud secrets get-iam-policy SECRET_NAME --project=PROJECT_ID
```

### Test Fails: Private Message Not Received

**Check:**
- [ ] User has initiated a DM with the bot at least once
- [ ] Service account has Chat Bot permissions
- [ ] Check bot logs for "Error sending private message"

### Test Fails: "Unauthorized" for Valid Approver

**Check:**
- [ ] Email matches exactly (case-sensitive)
- [ ] No extra spaces in `APPROVER_EMAILS`
- [ ] Bot was restarted after updating `.env`
- [ ] Check logs: `console.log` will show approver validation

## Test Checklist

Before going to production, verify:

- [ ] All happy path tests pass
- [ ] Error cases are handled gracefully
- [ ] Private messages work correctly
- [ ] Authorization works as expected
- [ ] Multiple concurrent requests work
- [ ] Invalid inputs don't crash the bot
- [ ] Logs are clear and informative
- [ ] Health endpoint responds correctly

## Performance Testing

For production readiness, test:

1. **Load:** 10+ simultaneous secret requests
2. **Response time:** Approval card appears within 2 seconds
3. **Secret delivery:** DM arrives within 5 seconds of approval
4. **Memory:** Bot doesn't leak memory with pending requests

## Security Testing

Verify security measures:

- [ ] Secrets never appear in public spaces
- [ ] Only approvers can approve/deny
- [ ] Service account has minimal permissions
- [ ] API keys/credentials are not logged
- [ ] HTTPS is enforced for webhook

## Monitoring

Set up monitoring for:

- Request volume
- Approval/denial rates
- Error rates
- Response times
- Failed secret fetches
